# Connected-Component-Clustering
Author: Abdullah Refaey
Hands-on practice with:  Clustering Algorithm. Segmenting objects in binary images. Identifying, mapping, and clustering specific signs in different images.

1.	Aim: 
•	Practice in Connected Component Clustering Algorithm. 
•	Practice in Segmenting binary objects from background

2.	Input:
•	Grayscale image with 8-adjacent pixels with graylevel = 255. 
•	Dark background with graylevel = 0.

3.	Output:
•	Grayscale image with different objects at different well-separated gray levels.

4.	Environment:
•	Google Colab – Python3.
